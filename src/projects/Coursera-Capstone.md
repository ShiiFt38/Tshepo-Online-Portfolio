<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>As part of the final project for the Front End Developer course offered by Meta on Coursera, I undertook the development of a restaurant website. This project served as a culmination of the skills
and knowledge acquired throughout the course, providing a platform to showcase my proficiency in web development and design.</p>
<br>
<h1> Learning <span>Objectives</span></h1>
<p>The primary objective of this capstone project was to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of front end development concepts and techniques. Specifically, I aimed to achieve the following learning objectives: <br><br> Implement a controlled form to capture user input. <br>Design a webpage using Figma, a popular design tool. <br>Utilize advanced React.js components such as state management and useRef hook. <br>Solve authentic real-world problems through effective web development solutions.</p>

<br>
<h1> Design and <span>Development</span></h1>
<p>The design phase of the project involved creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface using Figma. I leveraged a UI kit that encapsulated the brand style, including colors and fonts specific to the restaurant's identity. Intergrating these seamlessly into the design created a cohesive and visually compelling website.
<br>
<br>
In the development phase, I employed React.js to build the frontend of the website. Leveraging, components, conditional rendering, array mapping, state management and hooks. I implemented dynamic components and interactive elements to enhance user engagement while maintaining consistency with the brand's aesthetic. Additionally, the controlled form was seamlessly integrated, ensuring a smooth user experience for reservations and feedback submimssion.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Key <span>Features</span></h1>
<p>1. Controlled Form: The website features a controlled form to capture user reservations and feedback, ensuring accurate data collection and validation. <br>2. Custom Webpage Design: Utilizing Figma, I designed a unique webpage layout tailored to the branding and theme of the restaurant, enhancing its visual appeal and user experience. <br>3. Advanced React.js Components: Implementation of advanced React.js components such as state management and useRef hook enabled dynamic content rendering and improved performance.<br>4. Responsive Design: The website is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the Front End Developer capstone project provided a valuable oppportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios. Through the development of a restaurant website, I successfully demonstrated proficiency in front end development concepts, design principles, and React.js techniques. this project not only strengthened my skills as a front end developer but also equipped me with the necessary tools to tackle complex web development challenges in future endeavors</p>
