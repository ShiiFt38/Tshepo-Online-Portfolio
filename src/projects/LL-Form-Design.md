title: "Little Lemon Form"
summary: "I was tasked with designing an online reservation feature and form for Little Lemon, a restaurant lacking such functionality. The challenge included addressing customer reluctance toward third-party apps and reducing wait times. Through user persona development, journey mapping, and Figma prototyping, the goal was to create a user-friendly solution that simplifies reservations, saving both time and resources for patrons."

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Little Lemon, a popular restaurant, faced a challenge in accommodating its customers efficiently due to the absence of an online reservation feature. The lack of such a system resulted in customer hesitancy towards third-party reservation apps, and patrons were often frustrated by long waiting times.I identified the absence of an online reservation system as a primary issueand  acknowledged customer reluctance towards third-party apps.I also recognized the problem of long waiting times affecting the customer experience.I conducted thorough research, including user persona development, to understand the target audience. Mapped the user journey to identify pain points and opportunities then utilized Figma to create wireframes and a prototype for the proposed online reservation feature.</p>

<h1> The <span>Situation</span></h1>
<p>I identified the absence of an online reservation system as a primary issue. Acknowledged customer reluctance towards third-party apps. Recognized the problem of long waiting times affecting the customer experience.</p>
<br>
<h1> The <span>Task</span></h1>
<p>To tackle this, I conducted thorough research, delving into user persona development to understand our target audience better. Mapping the user journey revealed pain points, and employing Figma, I crafted wireframes and a prototype for the proposed online reservation feature.</p>
<br>
<h1>The <span>Action</span></h1>
<p>I developed a detailed user persona named "Sarah," representing our target audience and exploring her needs, behaviors, and preferences related to restaurant reservations. I mapped Sarah's journey, highlighting pain points like long wait times and hesitancy towards third-party apps. Identifying key touchpoints, I focused on potential improvements, particularly within the online reservation process. Designing wireframes based on user journey insights, I created an interactive prototype using Figma, ensuring a simplistic and intuitive online reservation form.</p>
<br>
<h1> The <span>Result</span></h1>
<p>I introduced a seamless online reservation system tailored to Sarah's needs, addressing customer hesitancy with an in-house solution. The feature mitigated long waiting times by allowing customers to plan their visits in advance. I also included something that indicates the number of tables that are left, so it gives an idea of how crowded the restaurant is.</p>
<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The implementation of the Little Lemon online reservation feature not only resolved the immediate problem of long waiting times but also established a sense of trust with customers who preferred an in-house solution. The user-centric approach, from persona development to prototyping, ensured that the final design was both practical and aligned with user preferences.</p>
