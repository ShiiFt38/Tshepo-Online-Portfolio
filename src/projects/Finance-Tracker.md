<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> This project was part of an internship I did with the company, Zidio Development. I was part of a small group of developers, other interns, and we utilised a number of collaboration platforms, including Github, Google Meet, Whatsapp, and more.  FinTrackr revolutionizes the way individuals manage their finances, providing a user-friendly platform for tracking income, expenses, and budgeting goals. The application offers a centralized dashboard for an overview of financial health, coupled with detailed reports and personalized insights to aid in informed decision-making.</p>
<br>
<h1> Learning <span>Objectives</span></h1>
<p>The primary learning objectives of developing FinTrackr were to gain proficiency in frontend development using React.js, enhance skills in UI/UX design principles, and deepen understanding of financial tracking and management concepts. Additionally, the project provided valuable experience in collaborating within a team, implementing third-party libraries, and deploying web applications to production environments.
</p>
<br>
<h1> Design and <span>Development</span></h1>
<p>My role was active across both the design and the development processes of the web app. I designed several pages using Figma. Then leveraging modern technologies such as React.js, Chart.js, and Tailwind CSS, the application boasts an intuitive interface, responsive design, and scalable architecture. This was a learning experience for me, as I was utilising new libraries, such as Tailwind CSS and Chart.JS to work with react, but was able to understand and integrate the technologies into the interface. </p>
