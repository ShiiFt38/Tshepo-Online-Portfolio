<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> This course for this project was provided by Meta through Coursera. The task was to design and code a responsive home page for Lucky Shrub , a fictional company specialising in gardening products</p>
<br>
<h1> Learning <span>objectives</span></h1>
<p>The learning objectives I completed and benefited from in this project include, responsive design principles, HTML/CSS proficiency and mobile-first approach.I know how to apply responsive design techniques to ensure optimal user experience across various devices with different screen sizes. With this project I demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and CSS for structuring and styling web pages.</p>
<br>
<h1> Design and <span>Development</span></h1>
<p>This is a demo for a fictional company's website homepage. There was little planning involved in the development of this demo.Although there was no design beforehand, Coursera provided a template to follow for best coding practices to use when designing homepages. I did a little research on modern gardening product websites for inspiration and outlined the content structure and key features for the home page.
<br>
I employed semantic HTML5, implemented responsive images and elements for a well-structured and accessible document outline.For the layout I combined grid and flexbox designs, optimizing for both mobile and desktop views.This was accomplished with the aid of media queries.</p>
<br>
<h1>Key <span>Features</span></h1>
<p>This page features a display of Lucky Shrub's promotion banner.Including also a responsive navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes for easy access and visual aesthetic.It also features a product section that incorporates strategically placed call-to-action buttons to encourage user engagement.</p>
<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The Lucky Shrub project served as a valuable opportunity to apply responsive design principles in a real-world scenario. By successfully gaining hands-on experience and enhanced my skills in web development, setting the foundation for future projects and challenges.</p>
